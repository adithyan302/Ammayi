### Project Description
The Ammayi Simulator is a light-hearted, interactive web project that mimics the classic conversations you might have with a nosy but caring aunty (‚ÄúAmmayi‚Äù) in Kerala.
The page displays a series of typical ‚Äúlife questions‚Äù Ammayi might ask ‚Äî from job updates to marriage plans ‚Äî and responds differently depending on whether you answer Yes or No.

Users click the Yes or No buttons, triggering playful Malayalam-style responses, complete with emojis for extra expression. The conversation progresses through multiple questions until Ammayi runs out of topics and politely ends the chat.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
For years, Ammayis everywhere have been asking the same life-altering questions ‚Äî ‚ÄúJob entha?‚Äù, ‚ÄúBTech pass aayo?‚Äù, ‚ÄúKalyanam plan undo?‚Äù ‚Äî but sadly, there has been no way to simulate this relentless interview experience without actually meeting an Ammayi in person.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Ammayi Simulator ‚Äî a browser-based, emoji-filled, culturally accurate recreation of the Ammayi interrogation. Now you can get grilled about your life choices without leaving your chair, using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Whether you say Yes or No, Ammayi always has something to say.
